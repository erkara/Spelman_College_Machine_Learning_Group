# Spelman_College_Machine_Learning_Group
This repo contains the notebooks regarding the deep learning project with my students at Spelman College. 

**Laila N.Hayes** and **Princess Sampson** were supported by CODE Scholars Project funded by Accenture.

**Erin N.Ojeda** worked as a MathRamp Scholar funded my Mathematics Department. 

We covered the following topics throughout our research.



1. Introduction and General Motivation
2. Gradient Descent(GD) Algorithm
3. Project-1: Advertisement strategy
4. Project-2: Analyzing insurance charges
5. From Linear Regression to Neural Networks
6. Basics of Image Processing
7. Introduction to Pytorch
8. Image Recognition Part1:Feed Forward Neural Networks
9. Image Recognition Part2:Convolutional Neural Networks
10. Image_Recognition Part3:Data Augmentation Transfer Learning 
10. Image_Recognition Part4:Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna
