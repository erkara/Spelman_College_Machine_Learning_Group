# Spelman_College_Machine_Learning_Group
This repo contains the notebooks regarding our machine learning project with my students at Spelman College. 

**Laila N.Hayes, Nadley E.Aisuan** and **Princess Sampson** are working in the scope of CODE Scholars Project funded by Accenture.

**Erin N.Ojeda** is working in MathRamp Program funded my Mathematics Department. As we progress in the project, we will keep it update with new items. 

Our plan is to cover all the topics outlined below and evantually present our indvidual projects in Spelman College Spring Research Day. 



1. Introduction and General Motivation
2. Gradient Descent(GD) Algorithm
3. Project-1: Advertisement strategy
4. Project-2: Analyzing insurance charges
5. From Linear Regression to Neural Networks
6. Basics of Image Processing
7. Introduction to Pytorch
8. Image Classification: Part1 - Feed Forward Neural Networks
9. Image Classification: Part2- Convolutional Neural Networks
10. Additional Topics; GPU Computation on Google Colab,Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna**
